# Java Programming Assignment

## Overview

This assignment is designed to help you practice with Java programming, unit testing, version control using Git and GitHub, and the peer review process. You will create new Java classes and methods, write unit tests, and submit your work via a pull request (PR). Afterwards, you will participate in reviewing your peers' code.

## Objectives

- Learn and apply Java programming concepts.
- Practice using Git and GitHub for version control.
- Gain experience with code reviews and providing constructive feedback.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Fork and Clone the Repository

- **Fork this repository**: Click on the "Fork" button at the top right of this page to create a copy of this repository in your GitHub account.
- **Clone your forked repository** to your local machine:
  ```bash
  git clone [URL of your forked repository]
  cd [repository-name]
  ```

### Step 2: Branching

- Navigate into the repository directory on your local machine.
- Create and switch to a new branch off of the `starter-code` branch:
  ```bash
  git checkout -b feature/add-classes
  ```

## Assignment Tasks

### Part A: Implement Java Classes

- **Create Java Classes**: Based on the assignment, create specific Java classes and methods. Details of the classes and methods will be outlined below.

### Part B: Write Unit Tests

- **Implement Unit Tests**: Write tests for your classes using JUnit. Ensure your tests cover all new methods.

### Part C: Commit Your Changes

- **Commit changes** regularly with descriptive messages:
  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "Add a descriptive commit message"
  ```

### Part D: Push and Create a Pull Request

- **Push your branch** to GitHub:
  ```bash
  git push origin feature/add-classes
  ```
- **Create a Pull Request** against the `starter-code` branch in the main repository. Ensure your PR description clearly describes your changes.

## Peer Review Process

- Each student will be assigned another studentâ€™s PR to review.
- Provide feedback on code quality, adherence to assignment instructions, and test coverage.
- Leave constructive comments directly on lines of code in the GitHub interface.

## Submission Guidelines

- Ensure your PR is created by the assignment due date.
- Your submission will be considered complete after your PR is reviewed and you have responded to all the feedback.

## Grading Criteria

- Code functionality and correctness.
- Adherence to assignment guidelines.
- Quality and coverage of unit tests.
- Constructiveness of peer review feedback.
